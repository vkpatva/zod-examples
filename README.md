# Zod TypeScript Library Demo

This repository serves as a demonstration for utilizing the Zod library in a TypeScript project. Zod is a powerful TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library that simplifies handling complex data structures.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have Node.js, npm, and TypeScript installed on your machine.

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vkpatva/zod-examples
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd zod-examples
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Build the TypeScript files:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage

The main purpose of this demo is to showcase how Zod can be used to validate API data schemas in a TypeScript project. There are three example scripts you can use to explore different scenarios:

- Start a script using Zod for validation:

```bash
npm run start-zod
```

- Start a script without using Zod:

```bash
npm run start-withoutZod
```

- Start another example script without using Zod:

```bash
npm run start-example
```

Feel free to explore and modify the examples in the TypeScript files (`withZod.ts`, `withoutZod.ts`, `withoutZod2.ts`) to suit your specific use case.
